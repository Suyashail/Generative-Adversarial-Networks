# Generative-Adversarial-Networks
This is a practice code for learning GANs. The codes have been adapted from the TensorFlow and PyTorch documentations.
This repository consists of the various Generative Adversarial Models that have been developed by the deep learning researchers. 
1. GAN using Fully-Connected Layers (also called as Vanilla GANs)
2. Deep Convolution GAN (DCGANs)

These codes can be run directly on Google Colab without any modifications. Remember to turn on the GPU accelerator so that the training becomes faster.
